3. Summary: This is a BigData group project on ML where we classify if a patient missed his/her appointment at the clinic.
4. Business Problem:
- Patient no-shows are a long-standing problem that depletes resources and jeopardizes the quality of healthcare services. They also result in the loss of projected income, especially in services where resources are scarce and expensive. 
- This could be due to various factors ranging from Age related issues to environmental factors. It could also be due to other ailments patients might have which impede their scheduled visits. For this analysis, we will look at the patient data and try to predict the showup rate of the patients to their appointment at the clinic. 
- From the data, we are assuming that Age and the neighbourhood of the clinic could be major factors. So, let's look at the data, perform some exploratory data analysis, pre-process and build machine learning models to predict the likelihood of the patients no-shows.
